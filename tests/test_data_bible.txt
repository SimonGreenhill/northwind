# Notes:
The allophones [t̺s̺] [t̺ʰ] are described as apical post-alveolar, and have a dot under 
them in the original paper, which is unavailable to me.  I have therefore used the apical 
diacritic instead.
No mention of nasalization, length, or labialization is made in the discussion.  Based on the broad transcription nasalized
and lengthened vowels in the narrow transcription and labialized consonants have been allocated as allophones of their non-nasalized
counterpart or non-lengthened counterparts or non-labialized counterparts.
Likewise no mention of the vowels [ɚ], [ʌ]̈ [ʉ], [ʊ̟], [ëʷ], [iː], [iʷ], [i], [e], [e̝] and consonant [ʈʰ] is made, 
but based on the broad transcription they have been allocated as allophones.
No mention of the retroflex click [ǃ] is made.  It has not been listed in the sounds, because it is not possible
to determine its status from the paper.
In the original paper consonant length is indicated by doubling of the letter.

# Orthography notes:
All orthographies for Mapudungun underspecify for certain sounds. 
The orthography information comes from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapudungun_alphabet. 
The orthography as used in the bible translation does not seem to adhere to a single system, as per Wikipedia,
but all graphemes are identifiable based on a combination of the systems. 
<> represent graphemes, // represent phonemes.
